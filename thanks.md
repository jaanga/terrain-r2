Jaanga Terrain Thanks
=====================


## Insights

Jaume Sanchez and his "[Blocky Earth](http://www.clicktorelease.com/code/blocky_earth/)" for demonstrating the idea that elevations are obtainable and you can do reverse Mercator projections.

And also to Bjorn Sandvik and his tutorial at [Textural terrains with three.js](http://blog.thematicmapping.org/2013/10/textural-terrains-with-threejs.html).

And to [meetar]( http://edgeca.se/journey-to-the-center-of-web3d/ ) for his examples of height maps.

In particular, Danni's post on the [Canvas tag and Three.js]( http://danni-three.blogspot.com/2013/09/threejs-heightmaps.html ) really helped.

See also and in particular [FGx on GitHub]( http://fgx.github.io ) which has been the cause and the impetus for this work - as well as the links on the Technics page.

## Resources
None of this would be possible without [GitHub]( http://github.com) and its amazing pages facility.

Thank you [Khronos Group]( http://www.khronos.org/ ) and Ken Russell of Google for [WebGL]( http://www.khronos.org/webgl/ ),

And to [Learning WebGL]( http://learningwebgl.com/blog/ ) and the San Francisco [WebGL Developers Meetup]( http://www.meetup.com/WebGL-Developers-Meetup/ ).

## Tools

Thank you Mr.doob for [Three.js]( http://mrdoob.github.io ) 

In preparing earlier versions of this data much use was been made of [GDAL]( http://gdal.org ) and [Image Magick]( http://imagemagick.org ). Thank you for the useful tools.

## Map Overlays

The map overlays feature is still quite experimental and attributions and compliance with licensing agreements is shaky at best.

Thank you [Open Street Map]( http://openstreetmap.org/copyright ), [Google Maps]( https://www.google.com/maps/ ), [Open Cycle Map]( http://www.opencyclemap.org/ ), [Stamen Design]( http://stamen.com/ ), [MapQuest]( http://www.mapquest.com/ ) and many others for making your map images freely available.  

- and for sharing the know-how: [TMS/Slippy Map Math]( http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames#Tile_servers )

It is the intention - as this work settles down - to comply fully with all attribution and licensing requirements.


## Gazetteer Data

The Golembeck gazetter data used to create the places-2000.csv is from [Latitude and Longitude for Selected Cities]( http://www.golombek.com/locations.html ).
A number of locations have been added to the gazetteer.

The IHO-IOC GEBCO Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names is from [GEBCO]( http://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/undersea_feature_names/ )


## Data Sources

Steven Horner's GeoJSON data sourced from [stevenhorner / PeakVisibility]( https://github.com/stevenhorner/PeakVisibility/ )

Previously used sources for the height maps for levels 0 to 4 include:  
[CleanTOPO2]( http://www.shadedrelief.com/cleantopo2/index.html ).  
The license is: 'You are welcome to use the contents of this site for personal use.'  Thank you.

Global Tectonics [GTOPO30 Topography On-Line Map Construction Tool]( http://www.serg.unicam.it/Gtopo30.htm ).  

And without Jonathan de Ferranti's data on [Viewfinder Panoramas]( http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/ ) the world would still be flat...
