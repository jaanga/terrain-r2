Jaanga Terrain Thanks
=====================


## Insights

Jaume Sanchez and his "[Blocky Earth](http://www.clicktorelease.com/code/blocky_earth/)" for giving me the idea that elevations are obtainable and you can do reverse Mercator projections.

And also to Bjorn Sandvik and his tutorial at [Textural terrains with three.js](http://blog.thematicmapping.org/2013/10/textural-terrains-with-threejs.html).

And to [meetar]( http://edgeca.se/journey-to-the-center-of-web3d/ ).

In particular, Danni's post on the [Canvas tag and Three.js]( http://danni-three.blogspot.com/2013/09/threejs-heightmaps.html ) really helped.

See also and in particular [FGx on GitHub]( http://fgx.github.io ) which has been the cause and the impetus for this work - as well as the links on the Technics page.

## Resources
None of this would be possible without [GitHub]( http://github.com) and its amazing pages facility.
