## Concept

_The following is a copy of the the text on the Moon Voyager Read Me_

### Issue

From earth, we 'see' the moon as a flat one-sided disk. Yet we know it is a 3D orb with a surface full of complexity.

## Mission

To provide a way of flying over the sphere of the moon in 3D and to see its craters and rills in detail
To show the usually hidden backside of the moon as easily as the front


## Things to Do

* Edit the auto rotation variable to change the speed of the spin of the moon
* Edit heighPlacard to move the location signboards up or down
* Edit the default height scale



## Mars Features

* 1440 x 720 terrain data points with 255 heights
* 'Travel' over the moon in 3D faster than any satellite
	* Use one finger to rotate
	* Pinch with two fingers to zoom in and out
	* use three fingers to pan
* Gazetteer takes you to 97 locations
	* All locations available via a drop-down list
	* Clicking a location in the drop-down takes you to the location

* Slider to adjust vertical scale in real-time
* Camera position follows cursor keys
	* Latest camera position is used to control camera position when using cursor keys 

<!--
* Supports permalinks

	* [Gassendi]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-r2/viewers/moon-rover-mobile/dev/index.html#30 )
	* [Tycho]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-r2/viewers/moon-rover-mobile/dev/index.html#93 )
-->

## Road Map

* 'Zoom All' and 'Zoom In' buttons
* Toggle between short and long gazetteers
* Links to Data sources such as WikiMoon for each location
* First person control moon flyover capability
* Supports permalinks
* Click on a placard to go there
* Permalinks to set target and camera positions
* Sunlight and shadows
* Textures and materials to 3D terrain
* 3D models of lunar landers in their locations
* Locations of Apollo photographs - perhaps as geojson data

## Issues

* Text flashes annoyingly as it moves
