## Concept

### Mission  
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->
To make 3D geophysical data observable in 3D with open access data and open source tools

To supply methods, tools, data and demos to help create lively 3D cartography - faster and more easily than ever before

### Vision  
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->
To enable people who are interested in cartography and geography and are not programmers but have some understanding of some aspects of coding
to develop news ways of using 3D mapping data and explore news ways of visualizing that data

## Access to Data

You have four ways to access the data for your own use. These methods will be described in detail in due course.

### Fork or download to local machine

### Fork to GitHub Only

### Embed in <iframe>

### Simple linking


## Acknowledgements

Much of the data used in Jaanga Terrain started life here started lifw aboard the International Spce Station 
as part of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM):

## Project Links

Previous version of this web site: [Jaanga Terrain]( ../terrain/index.html ). 
Provides access to earlier versions of the data and viewers as well as much information as how that data was sourced and manipulated.


Jaanga is a [GitHub]( http://github.com) [organization account]( https://help.github.com/articles/what-s-the-difference-between-user-and-organization-accounts ) and has multiple owners and admins. 
All Jaanga scripts are [FOSS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software ).


## System Requirements

In order to run the script you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/)
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Generally this means a computer with an Intel Core i5 processor or better with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia. 
Successful use of the script on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. 
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.
 
The script is currently being built and tested with the Google Chrome browser. 
Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such time as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.
