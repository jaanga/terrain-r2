Go straight to the [\*fun parts\*]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-srtm30-plus-viewers/terrain-srtm30-plus-viewers.html )

Jaanga Terrain is in the process of being completely updated.

Currently this release supplies 30 second ( 1 km ) SRTM data and data viewers. 
1 second / 30 meter data is in the works and will start appearing here soon.

## Concept

### Mission  
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->
To make 3D geophysical data observable in 3D with open access data and open source tools

To supply methods, tools, data and demos to help create lively 3D cartography - faster and more easily than ever before.

To provide the background and details and instructions so that you can do this too. 

### Vision  
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->
To enable people who are interested in cartography and geography and are not programmers but have some understanding of some aspects of coding
to develop news ways of using 3D mapping data and explore news ways of visualizing that data

## Access to Data

You have numerous  ways to access the data for your own use. These methods will be described in greater detail in due course.

### Simple linking

You may link directly to the Jaanga Terrain heightmap data PNG files from yur own domain and use these files as data sources. 
All that is require is that you add the line `heightMap.crossOrigin = 'Anonymous';` to any images in your JavaScript file.  

For a simple demo, see: <http://theo-armour.github.io/theo-armour.testing/png-tms7-viewer-3d-features/r1/template-png-tms7-viewer-3d.html>

### Embed in `iframe`

If you need more complex user interface - using jQuery and other libraries - you might consider embedding the Jaanga Terrain script in an iframe in a web page served from your site.

For a simple demo, see: <http://theo-armour.github.io/theo-armour.testing/png-tms7-viewer-3d-features/r1/png-tms7-viewer-3d.html>

### Fork to GitHub Only

If you need full access to the data but do want to download gigabytes of data, 
you might consider forking the data to your GitHub online gh-pages repository only.

Download just a few heightmaps for building and testing your scripts. 
Once finished, upload your script to the gh-pages repository where it can access the entire data set.

### Fork or download to local machine

Of course, if you with you can fork or download a zip file with the entire Jaanga Terrain data set. 
It's all open data.

## Acknowledgements

Much of the data used in Jaanga Terrain started life aboard the International Space Station 
as part of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM):

## Features
<!-- and benefits -->

Everything FOSS or Open Data

* Source and data hosted on free server GitHub

Coded for Dummies

* Follows [Mr.doobs' manifesto]( https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/README.md ): 'to create a lightweight 3D library with a very low level of complexity â€” in other words, for dummies'
* Everything written in JavaScript
* If you know beginner JavaScript you should be able to understand most of the functions fairly quickly and easily
* 'If/then', 'for' loops and '=' are all you need to know
* Small files that are easy to copy into your own scripts

Coded to help non-programmers do some programming

* Based upon a very popular 3D library - with many examples and much support
* Easy to add animations, shaders, physics and more
* Jaanga Terrain is about you enhancing your science, engineering and design with some aspects of coding - and \*not\* having to be a full-stack programmer

UI Features

* Display enables pan, rotate and zoom with pointing device
* Full-screen display with translucent menus
* Menus slide out of te way
* Menus have an accordion feature

## Issues / Bugs

Message to: jaanga [at] googlegroups [dot] com.

## Project Links

Previous version of this web site: [Jaanga Terrain]( ../terrain/index.html ). 
Provides access to earlier versions of the data and viewers as well as much information as how that data was sourced and manipulated.


Jaanga is a [GitHub]( http://github.com) [organization account]( https://help.github.com/articles/what-s-the-difference-between-user-and-organization-accounts ) and has multiple owners and admins. 
All Jaanga scripts are [FOSS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software ).


## System Requirements

In order to run the script you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/)
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Generally this means a computer with an Intel Core i5 processor or better with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia. 
Successful use of the script on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. 
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.
 
The script is currently being built and tested with the Google Chrome browser. 
Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such time as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.
